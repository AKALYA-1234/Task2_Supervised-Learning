📘 README – Task 2: Supervised Learning

App link:https://task2supervised-learning-s9ja4zgaxvagtrg4q5sbgg.streamlit.app/

🌟 Introduction

This project explores the power of Supervised Machine Learning (ML).
Supervised ML is a method where models learn from labeled data 🏷️ — meaning the dataset has both inputs (features) and outputs (target values).

The main notebook Task2_Supervised_learning.ipynb walks through the complete ML pipeline:
✨ Data preprocessing
✨ Visualization (EDA)
✨ Model training
✨ Model evaluation
